Dealing with literals:
    large ints*
    different bases
        different bases with decimals*
    strings
        string literal as char
        char literal as string
    sets
    maps

Issues with other things:
    All operators that deal with types don't handle InferredType
    Potential problem when calling a function several times, since the interpreter may modify function variables and not change it back
    and does not short because interpret outside of evaluate

    automatic inverse evaluation
    structures/classes
    inheritance
