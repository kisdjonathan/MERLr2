Dealing with literals:
    large ints*
    different bases
        different bases with decimals*
    strings
        string literal as char
        char literal as string
    sets
    maps

Issues with other things:
    All operators that deal with types don't handle InferredType

    automatic inverse evaluation
    inheritance
    function argument with types
    function overload with default values
    char literal
    ;else option
