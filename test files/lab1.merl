/*  BACKGROUND
*       there are N people, numbered 1 through N, who are playing a game.
*       a number - M - is chosen.
*       the people sit in order in a circle, and every M-th person is removed (in the same order) until only one person is left.
*       the last person left is the winner.
*       for example, for N=7, and M=3, if the game starts with player 1, then the people lose in the following order: 3,6,2,7,5,1
*           in which case player 4 wins
*   LAB
*       given N and M, output the starting player (x) in order for player 1 to win
*   INPUT
*       N, M
*   OUTPUT
*       x
