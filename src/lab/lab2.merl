*       given two lists of N numbers: S and T, repeat the each of the numbers of set S[i] a number of times indicated by T[i].
*       then output the numbers of the combined list, U.
*       for example, for N=5, S=[3,2,2,9,1], and T=[3,2,2,2,1], A=4, B=7, the list would be:
*           [3,3,3,2,2,2,2,9,9,1],
*   INPUT
*       N
*       S[1] S[2] ... S[N]

*   OUTPUT
*       U[1] U[2] ...
